RETIREMENT GUY: Mr. Fredrickson! Wait! Come back!
CARL: NO! I’m going to Paradise Falls!
RG: You can’t do that...there’s a court order. You HAVE to go to Shady Oaks.
CARL: Ha! Over my dead body!
RG: What’s wrong with Shady Oaks?
CARL: That’s just not where I’m supposed to be.
RG: What are you talking about? The court said--
CARL: I don’t care what the court said! I’m keeping my promise to Ellie!
RG: Who’s Ellie?
CARL: None of your concern.
RG: Where are you going?
CARL: Not Shady Oaks!
RG: But you attacked a construction worker!
CARL: He broke my mailbox!
RG: You broke his head!
CARL: So?
RG: Those are two totally different things.
CARL: Oh, he’ll live.
RG: Just come back, Mr. Fredrickson. Maybe we can sort this out.
CARL: No!
RG: How are you running so fast?
RUSSELL: Hi, Mr. Fredrickson!
CARL: Eh? Who are you?
RUSSELL: Good afternoon. My name is Russell, and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12. Are you in need of any need of assistance to day, sir?
CARL: No.
RUSSELL: I could help you cross the street.
CARL: No.
RUSSELL: I could help you cross your yard?
CARL: No.
RUSSELL: I could...help you cross your porch?
CARL: No.
RUSSELL: Well, I gotta help you cross somethin’.
CARL: Uh, no, I’m doing fine.
RUSSELL: Uh...let me try again. Good afternoon. My name is Russell, and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54--.
CARL: Kid!
RUSSELL: Are you in any need of assist--?
CARL: Thank you, but I don’t need any help.
RUSSELL: But Mr. Fredrickson, could I just--?
CARL: No.
RUSSELL: But--?
CARL: No.
RUSSELL: But, Mr. Fredrickson, the sooner I can assist you--.
CARL: Alright, alright. Proceed.
RUSSELL: Good afternoon--.
CARL: Skip to the end!
RUSSELL: See these? These are my Wilderness Explorer badges. You may notice one is missing. It’s my Assisting the Elderly Badge. If I get it, I’ll become a Senior Wilderness Explorer. The wilderness must be explored! Caw! Caw! Roar! It’s gonna be great. There’s a big ceremony, and all the dads come, and they pin on our badges.
CARL: So, you wanna assist an old person?
RUSSELL: Yep! Then I’ll be a Senior Wilderness Explorer.
CARL: Well, I can’t help you. I don’t need any assistance.
RUSSELL: Well, I’m gonna keep running until you can think of something for me to assist you with. Oh! Oh! Oh! Did you know that a single cloud could weigh more than one million pounds? Oh, and my tribe leader just told me last week that one in five adults believe that there are aliens disguised as humans. And and and--.
CARL: Alright, no more fun facts. I don’t like fun facts.
RUSSELL: Oh, ok. That’s alright. We can talk about something else. Oh, we can play twenty questions. Do you want to play twenty questions? I have a lot of questions. Why are we running?
CARL: I think a better question is why are you running?
RUSSELL: Haha, that’s a good one Mr. Fredrickson. Oh! Oh! Oh! Mr. Fredrickson, would you sign off on my badge if I help you run?
RUSSELL: Hey, Mr. Fredrickson, is that guy chasing us?
RUSSELL: Mr. Fredrickson, are you in trouble?
RUSSELL: Wow, Mr. Fredrickson, you move fast for an old guy.
RUSSELL: Mr. Fredrickson, how old did you say you were?
CARL: How about we play a game?
RUSSELL: Oh, oh, oh, I love games!
CARL: Let’s see who can stay quiet the longest.
RUSSELL: Oh, my mom loves that game.
CARL: Yeah, I bet. Ready. 
RUSSELL: Yeah, yeah, I’m ready.
CARL: Set. 
RUSSELL: I’m so gonna beat you, Mr. Fredrickson.
CARL: Go.

RUSSELL: Mr. Fredrickson, can we stop for some ice--Whoa, are those balloons, Mr. Fredrickson? Did you make that?
CARL: Yeah, I did.
RUSSELL: Why?
CARL: I’m going on an adventure.
RUSSELL: An adventure? Where? Can I come with you?
CARL: Paradise Falls.
RUSSELL: Whoa, you’re going to South America?
CARL: Don’t worry, Ellie...We’ll make it. I’m keeping my promise.
